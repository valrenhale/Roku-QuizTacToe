  DAY 16 - 7/7 MONDAY (AP SCORES OUT)
  Tony working on randomizing question functionality with Sami; Sofia and Kathy working on showing correct answer when user gets question wrong; Sam working on 
  adding new questions to app; finished all --> app functionality done
  Future tasks:
  1) bug with cursor when already won square
  2) strikethrough

  DAY 17 - 7/8 TUESDAY
  Tony fixing bug number 2 making strikethroughs for winning combos; Kathy and Sofia cannot fix bug number 1 (really hard to) because when click box to put down 
  x/o leads to the question; cannot disable click since since not indexed on second time (goes by whether x/o has been put down in a box); if disable will disable 
  for all (so cursor cannot be disabled and set focus to false) :((
  UPDATE: Tony fixed bug number 1; also fixed bug number 2 with mentor Khoa (diagonals); Bao and mentor Sami made AI player mode; Sofia and Kathy fixed wrong audio
  when player loses turn; Sam added new questions
